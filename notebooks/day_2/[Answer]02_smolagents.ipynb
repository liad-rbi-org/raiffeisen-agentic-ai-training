Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $2.70, up 429% from a year ago and up 148% from the previous quarter. A new computing era has begun. Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA.  NVIDIA GPUs connected by our Mellanox networking and switch technologies and running our CUDA AI software stack make up the computing infrastructure of generative AI.  During the quarter, major cloud service providers announced massive NVIDIA H100 AI infrastructures. Leading enterprise IT system and software providers announced partnerships to bring NVIDIA AI to every industry. The race is on to adopt generative AI,” he said. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, NVIDIA returned $3.38 billion to shareholders in the form of 7.5 million shares repurchased for $3.28 billion, and cash dividends. As of the end of the second quarter, the company had $3.95 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorization. On August 21, 2023, the Board of Directors approved an additional $25.00 billion in share repurchases, without expiration. NVIDIA plans to continue share repurchases this fiscal year.NVIDIA will pay its next quarterly cash dividend of $0.04 per share on September 28, 2023, to all shareholders of record on September 7, 2023.',\n",
       " 'Outlook NVIDIA’s outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 is as follows:Revenue is expected to be $16.00 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.5% and 72.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.  GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.95 billion and $2.00 billion, respectively.  GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expense are expected to be an income of approximately $100 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.Highlights NVIDIA achieved progress since its previous earnings announcement in these areas:  Data Center Second-quarter revenue was a record $10.32 billion, up 141% from the previous quarter and up 171% from a year ago. Announced that the NVIDIA® GH200 Grace™ Hopper™ Superchip for complex AI and HPC workloads is shipping this quarter, with a second-generation version with HBM3e memory expected to ship in Q2 of calendar 2024.
