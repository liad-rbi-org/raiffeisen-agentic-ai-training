    "*Lexical search* is a type of search where a query is compared against a collection of text documents (as short as a sentence or as long as an entire article) by directly matching the words in the query. For example, given a query like \"What is a cat?\", you would look for documents that contains one or more of the words: \"What\", \"is\", \"a\", \"cat\". You can assign a score to each document based on how important each word is (by assigning a score to each word), and how many words are matched (e.g. by summing up the scores).\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditionally, retrieval was simply a keyword(s) search, aka a boolean search. The retrieval systme just looked for the existance of these words in the document. \n",
    "Soon enough, we learned that it's not enough. While all words were born equal, some are more equal than others.  \n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF is an algorithm that learns to reweight the words based on their frequencies: frequent words that appear often in the many documents get less weight, and rare words gets an increased weight.\n",

    "## Stop Word Removal and Stemming\n",
    "\n",
    "In real-world scenario, we must compromize between the model accuracy and its performance in terms of speed and space. One of the main factors to consuming space is the vocabulary size, the number of different tokens (types) we take into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main techniques to reduce the number of types:\n",
    "1. Removing stop words\n",
    "2. Stemming and Lemmatization\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check them out:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stop Word Removal\n",
    "Stop words are common words in a language (like ```\"the\"```, ```\"is\"```, ```\"and\"```) that appear frequently but carry little semantic meaning. Removing them reduces noise, decrease the number of tokens we must store, and therefore may improve the retrieval efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Original: ```\"The cat is sitting on the mat.\"```  \n",
    "After Stop Word Removal: ```\"cat sitting mat\"```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stemming & Lemmatization\n",
    "[*Stemming*](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nlp/snowball-stemmer-nlp/) reduces words to their root form by chopping them abruptly, so that different variants of a word are treated as the same token. This helps in reducing the dimensionality, the number of different words we treat, as well as matching similar concepts and words, as they are all mapped to the same word.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Words: ```\"Consult\", \"Consultant\", \"Consulting\", \"Consultantative\", \"Consultants\"```  \n",
    "After Stemming: ```\"consult\"```\n",
    "\n",
    "*Lemmatization* reduces words to their base or dictionary form (aka lemma). Unlike stemming, which simply chops off the end of a word, lemmatization ensure the resulting lemma is a valid word. For example, \"better\" is lemmatized to \"good\" instead of a non-dictionary root word."

    "- **No contextual or phrase understanding**  \n",
    "  Multi-word expressions and context-dependent meaning are poorly handled; phrase matches are often missed unless explicitly indexed.\n",
