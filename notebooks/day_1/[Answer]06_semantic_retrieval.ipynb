    "# Semantic Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic retrieval is the process of searching and ranking information based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches. \n",
    "Traditional search systems like TF-IDF rely heavily on shared vocabulary—documents are considered relevant only if they contain the same words as the query. \n",
    "Semantic retrieval goes further by understanding context, relationships between words, and intent behind a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using modern language models and vector representations, semantic retrieval converts text into embeddings—numerical representations of meaning. \n",
    "Instead of matching tokens, it measures similarity in conceptual space, enabling results like matching ```\"electric vehicles\"``` with ```\"automakers invest in EVs\"``` or ```\"digital currency regulations\"``` with ```\"cryptocurrency policy updates\"```.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shift leads to more accurate search results, greater robustness to synonyms and paraphrasing, and more intuitive answers—especially in domains where wording varies widely, such as finance, law, or customer support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset and Search\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used in this task is a subset of a [collection of financial news articles](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Brianferrell787/financial-news-multisource). \n",
    "The corresponding text embeddings have already been generated and included in this repository. \n",
    "As a result, once an instance of the class below is initialized, it can immediately be used to query the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The semantic search process works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The search query is embedded using the same model that was used to embed the dataset.\n",
    "2. The query embedding is compared against all document embeddings to find the top-k most similar items. As with TF-IDF search, cosine similarity is used to measure relevance.\n",
    "3.The most relevant results are returned to the user."

       "['Carly Fiorina: Ted Cruz says \\'whatever\\' to get elected\\n\\nWashington (CNN)Carly Fiorina, herself recently accused of pandering on Twitter, chided Ted Cruz on Sunday, saying he \"says whatever he needs to say to get elected.\" Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive and Cruz\\'s rival for the GOP nomination, hit Cruz in an interview with CNN\\'s Dana Bash on \"State of the Union.\" She kept up her criticism of the Texas senator for his 2013 push for a government shutdown in an ill-fated attempt to repeal President Barack Obama\\'s signature health care law. \"Ted Cruz is just like any other politician. He says one thing in Manhattan, he says another thing in Iowa,\" Fiorina said Sunday. Recordings of Cruz speaking about gay marriage to donors in New York City appear to differ in style, but not substance, from his speeches to conservative supporters. \"He says whatever he needs to say to get elected, and then he\\'s going to do as he pleases,\" she said. \"I think people are tired of a political class that promises much and delivers much of the same.\" Cruz on conference call: I\\'ll win, but attacks are coming In the interview, Fiorina, a Stanford alum, also dismissed social media criticism of her New Year\\'s Day tweet in which she said she was rooting for Iowa over Stanford in the Rose Bowl. Fiorina tweeted: \"Love my alma mater, but rooting for a Hawkeyes win today. #RoseBowl\" Fiorina said her tweet was tongue-in-cheek, and people in Iowa knew she \"was torn\" on the game, noting she\\'d attended a Hawkeyes tailgate in the fall. \"Let\\'s just say if the biggest mistake I make is a tongue-in-cheek tweet about a Rose Bowl, the American people will sleep safely when I am president of the United States,\" Fiorina said. Skywriters have message for Trump at Rose Parade',\n",

The move is part of an overall $1 million the super-PACs, which are each called Keep the Promise, plan to spend on ads in the early voting states on behalf of Cruz, according to multiple reports.The uptick in spending comes as Cruz has become a favorite in recent weeks to win the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1. The advertising is an effort to boost him in other states where he's also polled well.News of the super-PAC spending comes on the heels of the campaign itself raising nearly $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, putting the candidate in a strong position a month away from the first caucus.
